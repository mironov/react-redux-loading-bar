A simple React component that provides Loading Bar (aka Progress Bar) for long running tasks. Works out of the box with [`redux-promise-middleware`](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware) and can be easily tweaked for other usage.

![Demo GIF](http://d.pr/i/haL8+)

Consists of:

* React component — displays loading bar and simulates progress
* Redux reducer — manages loading bar's part of the store
* Redux middleware — dispatches `SHOW`/`HIDE` for actions with promises

## Examples

See [Demo](http://mironov.github.io/react-redux-loading-bar/) or its [source code](https://github.com/mironov/react-redux-loading-bar/tree/gh-pages/src).

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save react-redux-loading-bar
```

## Usage

Mount the `LoadingBar` component anywhere in your application:

```es6
import LoadingBar from 'react-redux-loading-bar'

export default class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <header>
        <LoadingBar />
      </header>
    )
  }
}
```

Good news is that it doesn't include any positioning, so you can attach it to the top of any block or the whole page.

Install the reducer to the store:

```es6
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import { loadingBarReducer } from 'react-redux-loading-bar'

const reducer = combineReducers({
  // app reducers
  loadingBar: loadingBarReducer,
})
```

*(Optional)* Apply middleware to automatically show and hide loading bar on actions with promises:

```es6
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import { loadingBarMiddleware } from 'react-redux-loading-bar'
import rootReducer from './reducers'

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  // promise middleware
  applyMiddleware(loadingBarMiddleware())
)
```

## Usage with custom suffixes or another Promise Middleware

You can configure promise type suffixes that are used in your project:

```es6
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import { loadingBarMiddleware } from 'react-redux-loading-bar'
import rootReducer from './reducers'

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  applyMiddleware(
    loadingBarMiddleware({
      promiseTypeSuffixes: ['REQUEST', 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE'],
    })
  )
)
```

If you're not using `redux-promise-middleware` or any other promise middleware, you can skip installing the `loadingBarMiddleware()` and dispatch `SHOW`/`HIDE` actions manually. The other option is to write your own middleware that will be similar to the [bundled one](https://github.com/mironov/react-redux-loading-bar/blob/master/src/loading_bar_middleware.js).

## Usage without middleware

You can dispatch `SHOW`/`HIDE` actions wherever you want by importing the corresponding action creators:

```es6
import { showLoading, hideLoading } from 'react-redux-loading-bar'

dispatch(showLoading())
// do long running stuff
dispatch(hideLoading())
```

You need to dispatch `HIDE` as many times as `SHOW` was dispatched to make the bar disappear. In other words, the loading bar is shown until all long running tasks complete.

## Usage with jQuery Ajax Requests

If you happen to use jQuery for Ajax requests, you can dispatch `SHOW`/`HIDE` actions on `ajaxStart`/`ajaxStop` global events:

```es6
$(document).on('ajaxStart', this.props.actions.showLoading)
$(document).on('ajaxStop', this.props.actions.hideLoading)
```

See [a demo](http://mironov.github.io/react-redux-loading-bar/?ajax) or checkout [the code](https://github.com/mironov/react-redux-loading-bar/blob/gh-pages/src/demo_ajax.js).

## Styling

You can apply custom styling right on the `LoadingBar` component, for example you can change the color and height of it:

```es6
<LoadingBar style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', height: '5px' }} />
```

Or specify your own CSS class:

```es6
<LoadingBar className="loading" />
```

## Settings

You can change next properties: updateTime (by default 200ms), maxProgress (by default 90%), progressIncrease (by default 5%):

```es6
<LoadingBar updateTime={100} maxProgress={95} progressIncrease={10} />
```

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```
